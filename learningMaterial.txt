For this Project 1 assignment, I did not use any code directly copied and pasted from any source that was not already
mentioned in the josemataProject1.go file.

However, knowledge, tips, and other useful information about Go was obtained from the following sources, among others:

Go by Example: If/Else: https://gobyexample.com/if-else
Forever: https://go.dev/tour/flowcontrol/4
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/golang-program-to-compare-two-strings-by-ignoring-case: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/golang-program-to-compare-two-strings-by-ignoring-case
